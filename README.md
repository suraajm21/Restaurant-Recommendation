How the Restaurant Recommendation System Works?

The rapid growth in data collection has led to a new era of a data-driven world. Data is used to create more efficient systems and thatâ€™s where recommender systems come in.

Recommendation systems are a type of information filtering systems because they improve the quality of search results and provide elements that are more relevant to the search item or that are related to the search history of the user.

These are active information filtering systems that personalize the information provided to a user based on their interests, relevance of the information, etc. Recommendation systems are widely used to recommend movies, items, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy, etc.

There are two types of recommendation systems:

Content-based filtering

Collaborative filtering

#### TF-IDF Vectorization

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors for each document. This will give you a matrix where each column represents a word in the general vocabulary (all words that appear in at least one document) and each column represents a restaurant, as before.
